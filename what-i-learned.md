# What I Learned

## Objects

This week we learned objects. Objects are an organized, matrix of information. More efficient than an array, it holds day by properties. For example, if you wanted to find a person's blood type in an object one could simply type  *person.bloodtype* instead of looping through data.

## Manipulation of data.

We had several assignments that taught us how to manipulate data by targeting properties. We were able to locate and manipulate different data types with objects as well.
